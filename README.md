## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

- **Authentication Failed**: Ensure your API keys and credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- **Network Issues**: Verify your network connectivity and ensure your server can reach the email service provider.
- **Invalid Email Addresses**: Check that all email addresses are correctly formatted.
- **Attachment Issues**: Ensure attachments are correctly encoded and within size limits.

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check Logs**: Always check your application logs for detailed error messages.
2. **Validate Credentials**: Double-check your credentials and permissions.
3. **API Limits**: Ensure you are not exceeding API rate limits or quotas.
4. **Service Status**: Verify that the email service provider is operational and not experiencing downtime.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to store credentials.
2. **Secret Managers**: Use secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault.
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive information both at rest and in transit.
4. **Least Privilege**: Follow the principle of least privilege for API keys and credentials.
